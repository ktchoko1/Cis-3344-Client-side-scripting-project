    Cars is a 2006 American computer-animated comedy-adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and 
    released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed and co-written by John Lasseter, it is Pixar's final 
    independently-produced motion picture before its purchase by Disney in May 2006. Set in a world 
    populated entirely by anthropomorphic cars and other vehicles, the film stars the voices of Owen Wilson, 
    Paul Newman (in his final acting role), Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin, 
    Michael Wallis, George Carlin, Paul Dooley, Jenifer Lewis, Guido Quaroni, Michael Keaton, Katherine Helmond 
    and John Ratzenberger. Race car drivers Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mario Andretti, Michael Schumacher and 
    car enthusiast Jay Leno (as "Jay Limo") voice themselves.

    Cars premiered on May 26, 2006 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, and was theatrically 
    released on June 9, 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for two Academy Awards
    including Best Animated Feature, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. The film 
    was released on DVD on November 7, 2006 and on Blu-ray in 2007. The film was accompanied by the short One
    Man Band for its theatrical and home media releases. Merchandise based on the film (including scale models 
    of several of the cars) broke records for retail sales of merchandise based on a Disney/Pixar film,[2] 
    bringing an estimated $10 billion for 5 years after the film's release.[3] The film was dedicated to Joe 
    Ranft, who was killed in a car accident during the film's production.
