                    <h2>Introduction to ReactJS</h2>
                    <p>
                        ReactJS is an open-source, component based front end library responsible only for view layer of the
                        the application. It is maintained by Facebook. ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mecanism to fill in data in HTML DOM.
                        The virtual DOM works fast owning to the fact that it only changes the individual DOM element instead of reloading complete DOM every time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A react application is made up multiple components, each responsible for outputting a small,reusable piece of HTML.
                        Components can be nested within other components to allow complex application to be built out of simple building blocks.
                        It allows you to write code in JSX which adds XML syntax to JavaScript. In this tutorial will learn some basic of reactJS as:

                    <h2>What is JSX?</h2>
                    JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension that can be used with React to deﬁne tree structures with attributes.
                    It has a familiar XML-like syntax, which makes it easy to adopt. JSX tags have tag names,
                    attributes as well as children. If an attribute is a string value, you would simply enclose the value in 
                    quotes. If the attribute is anything else, you would enclose the value in curly braces and it is then interpreted 
                    as a JavaScript expression. By using a JavaScript transpiler like babel, you are able to turn the JSX code into JavaScript 
                    that can be run in your browser. All of the HTML that you can write in the JSX is the same as normal HTML with a few exceptions.
                    For instance, class is a reserved word in React therefore, if you would like to specify a class as a parameter in an HTML tag you 
                    must use 'className' instead.

                    <h2>Components</h2>
                    <p>
                        A React component can be deﬁned as an ES6 class that extends the base React.
                        Component class. In its minimal form, a component must deﬁne a render method
                        that speciﬁes how the component renders to the DOM. The render method returns
                        React nodes, which can be deﬁned using JSX syntax as HTML-like tags.
                        The following example shows how to deﬁne a minimal Component:

                    </p>
                    <pre>
                    import React from 'react'
                    class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
                    render() {
                    return <span>Hello, World!</span> }
                       }
                        export default HelloWorld

                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        A Component can also receive props. These are properties passed by its parent in order to specify
                        some values the component cannot know by itself; a property can also contain a function that can be
                        called by the component after certain events occur - for example, a button could receive a function
                        for its onClick property and call it whenever it is clicked. When writing a component, its props can be accessed through the props object on the Component itself:

                    </p>
                    <pre>
                    import React from 'react'
                    class Hello extends React.Component {    
                    render() {        
                    return <span>Hello, {this.props.name}!</span>} 
                      }
                    export default Hello
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        The example above shows how the component can render an arbitrary string passed into the name prop by its parent.
                        Note that a component cannot modify the props it receives.
                        A component can be rendered within any other component, or directly into the DOM if it's the top most component, using React DOM
                    </p>

                </div>

                        <h2>State in ReactJS </h2>

                        <p>
                            State is the place where the data comes from. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible
                            and minimize the number of stateful components. If we have, for example, ten components that need data from
                            the state, we should create one container component that will keep the state for all of them. We can also define
                            State in React components is essential to manage and communicate data in your application. 
                            It is represented as a JavaScript object and has component level scope, it can be thought of as the private data of
                            your component.
                            In the example below we are deﬁning some initial state in the constructor function of our component and make use of it in the render function.    
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            class ExampleComponent extends React.Component { 
                             constructor(props){ 
                                  super(props);

                            // Set-up our initial state    
                            this.state = {      
                             greeting: 'Hi Buddy!'    
                            };  
                            }
                             render() {    
                            // We can access the greeting property through this.state    
                            return(      
                            <span>{this.state.greeting}</span>    
                             );  
                            }
                             } 
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            Every component has a state object and a props object. State is set using the setState method.
                            Calling setState triggers UI updates. If we want to set an initial state before any interaction occurs we can use the getInitialState method.
                            Below, see how we can set our component's state:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                        var MyComponent = React.createClass({
                        getInitialState: function(){
                        return {
                        count: 5
                        }
                       },
                        render: function(){
                        return (
                        <span>{this.state.count}</span>
                        )
                       }
                      });
                        </pre>
                    </div>

                        <p>
                            When we use our defined components, we can add attributes called props. These attributes are available
                            in our component as this.props and can be used in our render method to render dynamic data:  

                        </p>
                        <pre>
                        var MyComponent = React.createClass({

                         }
                         });

                        <p>
                            Here are some lifecycle methods in React you should know: 
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                componentWillMount - Invoked once, on both client & server before rendering occurs.  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                componentDidMount - Invoked once, only on the client, after rendering occurs.  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                shouldComponentUpdate - Return value determines whether component should update. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                componentWillUnmount - Invoked prior to unmounting component.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
