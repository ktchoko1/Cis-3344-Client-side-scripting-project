                    <p>HTML and CSS are easy languages to learn. But using to design a web require precise techniques and time. That what I am start learning from this course.</p>
                    <p>I learned how to design fixed <i>navigation</i> bar and <i>footer</i>, how to <i>organize</i> web files and to <i>published</i> web page.</p>

                    <p>The new thing that I learned in this lab is how to use AngularJS to simply implement code from a file instead of repeating them through out the files. This makes it convenient to work on specific part of the web.</p>

                            In this first part of javaScript , most of the basics that will allow a good foundation are learnt.
                            How you can get a reference to a DOM object, e.g. document.getElementById("element_id"), 
                            then (dynamically) enhance that object by adding your own properties to it. How a function can create 
                            (and return) an object with properties and methods.  How to associate a JavaScript function to a JavaScript 
                            event. I learnt more about edit, add to and object and how  to sort them.

                            In this assignment, I have injection dependency, how to implement delete method using the icon. 
                            I come acquainted with new methods such as create Element, append Child. I have also learnt about cookie 
                            which is textual data that associated with a web site and stored in a text file on the and userâ€™s computer by JavaScript code.
                            Cookie data is organized into name/value pairs JavaScript injection occurs when a hacker inputs data that has JavaScript in it and
                            then that data is stored on a web site's server. Then, whenever normal users visit that site and view that data, the hacker's JavaScript 
                            runs on these users computers and these users are hacked

                            JavaScript Framework, where I learn how to create a simple framework that offers HTML code reuse.
                            The HTML coder design their complete layout in a "template file" (file that has a placeholder for content)
                            then they create several HTML "snippet files" that contain their content. When the user clicks on a nav link, 
                            the framework code read (using AJAX) the appropriate HTML snippet file and place its content into the content placeholder.
                            This template technique is like how Visual Studio Dot Net implements HTML code reuse using what they call a "master file".

                            This lab is about database system, I learnt how use MySQL Workbench an open source GUI for the MySQL database management System.
                            MySQL Workbench is used to design, implement, and populate a database. We Write some SQL SELECT Statements, 
                            also how to insert, update, and delete record from the database.

                            I had never worked with APIs before this lab, so pretty much everything was new to me.
                            There was a fair bit of difficult getting everything to work correctly, 
                            but I figured it out at the end. For this lab I had to access my table which was created 
                            to store information about hair product.  The display  grabs the picture along with its title, 
                            price, material, description. Searching is based on the description for the image .

                            There was a fair bit of difficult putting the tutorial together. That was a good experience because i was
